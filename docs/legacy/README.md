# Legacy Testing Documentation

This folder contains historical testing documentation that has been superseded by the new organized testing structure.

## üìÅ Contents

### **[Testing Strategy and Challenges](TESTING_STRATEGY_AND_CHALLENGES.md)**
- **Original Purpose**: High-level testing strategy and implementation challenges
- **Status**: Content consolidated into [Testing Guide](../TESTING_GUIDE.md)
- **Archived**: December 2024

### **[Testing Approach](TESTING_APPROACH.md)**
- **Original Purpose**: Technical implementation details and code patterns
- **Status**: Content consolidated into [Testing Guide](../TESTING_GUIDE.md)
- **Archived**: December 2024

## üîÑ Migration Notes

These documents were part of the original testing documentation structure that became fragmented and redundant. Key content has been:

1. **Consolidated**: Important information moved to the main [Testing Guide](../TESTING_GUIDE.md)
2. **Organized**: Structured into logical sections with clear navigation
3. **Simplified**: Removed redundancy and improved readability
4. **Updated**: Refreshed with current practices and examples

## üìã Current Testing Documentation

## üóÇÔ∏è Preservation Reason

These files are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Audit trail of documentation evolution
- Specific implementation details that may be useful for troubleshooting
- Context for understanding the evolution of our testing strategy
