**Query 2: Error Rate**
```promql
(sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m]))) * 100
```
**Script**: 
> "Our error rate monitoring. We maintain less than 1% errors to ensure reliable service for students."

**Query 3: AI Service Performance**
```promql
brainbytes_ai_requests_total
```
**Script**: 
> "This tracks AI tutoring requests, which is core to our educational mission. We monitor both volume and response quality."

#### **Grafana Dashboards (1.5 minutes)**

**Script**:

### **SEGMENT 2: Alerting Configuration (2-3 minutes)**

#### **Alert Rules Overview (1 minute)**

**Script**: 
> "Proactive alerting is crucial for maintaining service quality. Let me show you our comprehensive alert configuration."

**Actions**:
1. Return to Prometheus (`http://localhost:9090`)
2. Navigate to **Status** â†’ **Rules**
3. Show the loaded alert rules

**Script**: 
> "We have multiple categories of alerts: system health, application performance, AI service specific, and business logic alerts."

**Key Alert Categories to Highlight**:
- **Critical Alerts**: Service down, high error rate, database issues
- **Warning Alerts**: High CPU/memory, slow response times
- **Business Alerts**: No active users, unusual traffic patterns
- **Filipino Context**: Mobile error rates, connection stability

#### **AlertManager Demonstration (1 minute)**

**Script**: 
> "AlertManager handles alert routing, grouping, and notifications. Let me show you the current alert status."

**Actions**:
1. Navigate to AlertManager (`http://localhost:9093`)
2. Show the main interface
3. Point out:
   - Current alerts (should be empty/green)
   - Alert grouping configuration
   - Notification routing

**Script**: 
> "Currently we have no active alerts, which indicates our system is healthy. In production, alerts would be routed to Slack, email, or SMS based on severity."

#### **Alert Configuration Deep Dive (1 minute)**

**Script**: 
> "Let me show you a specific alert rule to explain how our monitoring works."

**Actions**:
1. Return to Prometheus
2. Navigate to **Alerts** tab
3. Show configured alerts and their current status

**Example Alert to Explain**:
```yaml
- alert: HighErrorRate
  expr: (sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) / 
         sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m]))) * 100 > 5
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "High error rate detected"
    description: "Error rate is above 5% for more than 1 minute"
```

**Script**: 
> "This alert triggers when our error rate exceeds 5% for more than 1 minute. It's marked as critical because it directly impacts student experience."

---

### **SEGMENT 3: Live Incident Simulation (2-3 minutes)**

#### **Incident Setup (30 seconds)**

**Script**: 
> "Now I'll demonstrate our incident response capabilities by simulating a real performance issue and showing how our monitoring detects and helps resolve it."

**Actions**:
1. Ensure Grafana dashboard is visible
2. Have AlertManager tab ready
3. Prepare to execute stress test

#### **Trigger Incident (45 seconds)**

**Script**: 
> "I'm going to create high CPU load on our backend service to simulate a performance issue."

**Actions**:
1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Execute stress test:

```bash
# Method 1: Docker stress test
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q --filter "name=backend") sh -c "
yes > /dev/null &
yes > /dev/null &
yes > /dev/null &
sleep 15
killall yes
"
```

**Alternative Method** (if Docker method fails):
```bash
# Method 2: Generate load through requests
for i in {1..100}; do curl -s http://localhost/health > /dev/null & done
```

**Script**: 
> "I'm creating sustained CPU load. Watch how quickly our monitoring detects this issue."

#### **Monitor Detection (45 seconds)**

**Actions**:
1. Switch to Grafana dashboard
2. Point out CPU usage spike in real-time
3. Show metrics changing on the dashboard

**Script**: 
> "You can see the CPU usage spiking in real-time on our dashboard. Our alert threshold is set at 80% CPU usage for more than 2 minutes."

**Actions**:
1. Navigate to Prometheus **Alerts** tab
2. Show if alert is triggered (may take 1-2 minutes)
3. If alert appears, switch to AlertManager to show active alert

**Script**: 
> "In a production environment, this would immediately notify our on-call engineer via Slack and email. The alert provides context about which service is affected and the severity level."

#### **Investigation Process (30 seconds)**

**Script**: 
> "When responding to an incident, we use our dashboards to quickly investigate the root cause."

**Actions**:
1. Show investigation process in Grafana:
   - Check which service is affected
   - Look at resource utilization trends
   - Review recent deployment history
   - Check error rates and response times

**Script**: 
> "Our dashboards provide all the context needed to quickly identify whether this is a resource issue, application bug, or external dependency problem."

#### **Resolution and Recovery (30 seconds)**

**Script**: 
> "In this case, the high CPU was caused by our stress test. Watch as the system recovers automatically."

**Actions**:
1. Wait for stress test to complete (CPU should return to normal)
2. Show metrics returning to baseline in Grafana
3. Point out alert resolution (if alert was triggered)

**Script**: 
> "You can see the CPU usage returning to normal levels. In a real incident, we might scale resources, restart services, or deploy a hotfix depending on the root cause."

### **SEGMENT 4: Operational Procedures (1-2 minutes)**

#### **Documentation and Procedures (1 minute)**

**Script**: 
> "Beyond monitoring, we have comprehensive operational procedures documented for common scenarios."

**Actions**:
1. Briefly mention key operational procedures:
   - Health check procedures
   - Incident response playbooks
   - Escalation procedures
   - Post-incident review process

**Script**: 
> "Our monitoring is integrated with our operational procedures. Each alert includes runbook links and escalation paths."

#### **Business Context (1 minute)**

**Script**: 
> "For BrainBytesAI, monitoring is especially important because we serve Filipino students who may have limited internet connectivity and rely on mobile devices."

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- **Mobile-first monitoring**: Track mobile-specific error rates
- **Network resilience**: Monitor connection drops and timeouts
- **Educational context**: Track AI tutoring effectiveness
- **Peak usage patterns**: Monitor study session times

**Script**:
