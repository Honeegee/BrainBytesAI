2. Navigate to AlertManager (show green status)
3. Explain alert categories and thresholds

**Key Messages**:
- Proactive monitoring with intelligent alerts
- Multiple severity levels
- Business-context alerts for education platform
- Integration with notification systems

### Segment 3: Incident Simulation (2-3 minutes)
**Key Actions**:
1. Execute stress test command:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it $(docker ps -q --filter "name=backend") sh -c "yes > /dev/null & yes > /dev/null & sleep 15; killall yes"
   ```
2. Show CPU spike in Grafana
3. Demonstrate investigation process
4. Show recovery

**Key Messages**:

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Monitoring Stack is Down
**Immediate Actions**:
1. Stay calm and acknowledge the issue
2. Switch to backup screenshots
3. Explain: "This demonstrates why we have redundancy"
4. Focus on configuration and architecture discussion

**Script**: 
> "While we troubleshoot this, let me show you our monitoring architecture and configuration, which demonstrates the robustness of our design."

### If Dashboards Show No Data
**Immediate Actions**:
1. Check Prometheus targets first
2. If targets are down, restart containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart
   ```
3. Use historical screenshots
4. Explain the monitoring concept with static examples

### If Internet Connection Fails
**Immediate Actions**:
1. Switch to mobile hotspot immediately
2. Use local-only demonstrations
3. Focus on localhost URLs only
4. Have offline backup materials ready

### If Demo Runs Long
**Priority Order** (cut in this sequence):
1. Skip detailed Prometheus query explanations
2. Reduce dashboard navigation time
3. Shorten incident simulation
4. Focus on key messages only

### If Demo Runs Short
**Extension Options**:
1. Show additional Prometheus queries
2. Demonstrate more Grafana features
3. Explain alert rule configuration in detail
4. Discuss operational procedures more thoroughly

## üîß Quick Command Reference

### Health Check Commands
```bash
# Quick health check all services
curl -s http://localhost:9090/-/healthy && echo " ‚úÖ Prometheus OK" || echo " ‚ùå Prometheus FAIL"
curl -s http://localhost:3003/api/health && echo " ‚úÖ Grafana OK" || echo " ‚ùå Grafana FAIL"
curl -s http://localhost:9093/-/healthy && echo " ‚úÖ AlertManager OK" || echo " ‚ùå AlertManager FAIL"
curl -s http://localhost/health && echo " ‚úÖ Backend OK" || echo " ‚ùå Backend FAIL"
curl -s http://localhost:8090/health && echo " ‚úÖ AI Service OK" || echo " ‚ùå AI Service FAIL"
```

### Emergency Recovery
```bash
# Restart all monitoring services
docker-compose restart prometheus grafana alertmanager

# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View recent logs
docker-compose logs --tail=50 prometheus
docker-compose logs --tail=50 grafana
```

### Demo Prometheus Queries
```promql
# Basic request count
brainbytes_http_requests_total

# Request rate (requests per second)
rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m])

# Error rate percentage
(sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m]))) * 100

# Average response time
rate(brainbytes_http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) / rate(brainbytes_http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])

# AI service requests
brainbytes_ai_requests_total

# CPU usage percentage
100 - (avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)
```

### Stress Test Commands
```bash
# Primary method - Docker CPU stress
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q --filter "name=backend") sh -c "yes > /dev/null & yes > /dev/null & yes > /dev/null & sleep 15; killall yes"

# Backup method - Request flood
for i in {1..50}; do curl -s http://localhost/health > /dev/null & done; wait
```
