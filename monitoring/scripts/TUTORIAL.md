# Step-by-Step Tutorial: Using the BrainBytes Incident Simulator

This tutorial will walk you through using the incident simulator with detailed explanations of what happens at each step.

## 🎯 What This Tutorial Covers

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:
- How to trigger monitoring incidents
- How to observe alerts being generated
- How to resolve incidents
- How to interpret monitoring dashboards
- How the cAdvisor, Prometheus, and Alertmanager work together

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
1. Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Node.js installed
3. The BrainBytes monitoring stack running

## 🚀 Step 1: Start the Monitoring Stack

First, let's start all monitoring services:

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd C:\Users\Honey\Desktop\BrainBytesAI

# Start all services including monitoring
docker-compose up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps
```

**What's happening?**
- **cAdvisor** starts collecting container metrics
- **Prometheus** begins scraping metrics from all services
- **Alertmanager** starts listening for alerts
- **Grafana** loads with pre-configured dashboards

**Expected output:** You should see all services in "Up" status.

## 🔧 Step 2: Navigate to the Correct Directory

**IMPORTANT:** The incident simulator is in the `monitoring/scripts` directory, not the root!

```bash
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd monitoring\scripts

# Verify the file exists
dir incident-simulator.js
```

**Common mistake:** Running from the wrong directory will give you the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'C:\Users\Honey\Desktop\BrainBytesAI\incident-simulator.js'
```

## 📦 Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Make sure you're in monitoring/scripts directory
npm install
```

**What's happening?**
- Installing `axios` for HTTP requests to monitoring services
- Setting up the incident simulator environment

## 📊 Step 4: Check Initial System Status

Let's see the current state of our monitoring system:

```bash
node incident-simulator.js status
```

**Expected output:**
```
🚨 BrainBytes Incident Simulator
================================

2025-01-23T10:00:00.000Z ℹ️ Checking monitoring services availability...
2025-01-23T10:00:00.100Z ✅ Prometheus: Available
2025-01-23T10:00:00.150Z ✅ Alertmanager: Available
2025-01-23T10:00:00.200Z ✅ cAdvisor: Available
2025-01-23T10:00:00.250Z ✅ Grafana: Available
2025-01-23T10:00:00.300Z ℹ️ === SYSTEM STATUS ===
2025-01-23T10:00:00.350Z ✅ No active alerts
2025-01-23T10:00:00.400Z ✅ No active incidents
```

**What this tells us:**
- All monitoring services are healthy and responding
- No alerts are currently firing
- No incidents are currently active
- The system is ready for testing

## 🔥 Step 5: Trigger Your First Incident

Let's start with a simple error rate incident:

```bash
node incident-simulator.js trigger HIGH_ERROR_RATE
```

**Expected output:**
```
2025-01-23T10:01:00.000Z 🚨 Triggering High Error Rate incident...
2025-01-23T10:01:00.100Z ⚠️ Error generation started (10 errors/sec)
2025-01-23T10:01:00.150Z ℹ️ Expected alerts: HighErrorRate
2025-01-23T10:01:00.200Z 🚨 Incident triggered: high-error-1642939260000
```

**What's happening behind the scenes:**
1. The simulator starts making HTTP requests to non-existent endpoints
2. These requests generate 404 errors at a rate of 10 per second
3. Prometheus collects these error metrics every 15 seconds
4. The error rate calculation begins: `(errors / total_requests) * 100`

## ⏱️ Step 6: Wait and Observe (2-3 minutes)

This is the most important part - understanding the monitoring timeline:

```bash
# Check status every 30 seconds
node incident-simulator.js status
```

**Timeline explanation:**

### Minute 1 (0-60 seconds)
- **What's happening:** Errors are being generated
- **Prometheus:** Collecting metrics but alert rule not yet triggered
- **Alert status:** No alerts yet (this is normal!)
- **Why:** Most alert rules have a `for: 1m` or `for: 2m` clause

### Minute 2 (60-120 seconds)
- **What's happening:** Error rate threshold exceeded for required duration
- **Prometheus:** Alert rule evaluation triggers
- **Alert status:** Alert moves to "PENDING" state
- **Alertmanager:** Receives the alert but waits for confirmation

### Minute 3 (120+ seconds)
- **What's happening:** Alert confirmed as persistent issue
- **Alert status:** Alert moves to "FIRING" state
- **Alertmanager:** Sends notifications (if configured)
- **Dashboard:** Alert appears in Grafana

## 🔍 Step 7: Verify the Alert is Firing

Check the status again:

```bash
node incident-simulator.js status
```

**Expected output after 2-3 minutes:**
```
2025-01-23T10:03:00.000Z ℹ️ === SYSTEM STATUS ===
2025-01-23T10:03:00.100Z ⚠️ 1 active alert(s):
2025-01-23T10:03:00.150Z 🚨   1. HighErrorRate - firing
2025-01-23T10:03:00.200Z ⚠️ 1 active incident(s):
2025-01-23T10:03:00.250Z 🚨   high-error-1642939260000: High Error Rate (started: 2025-01-23T10:01:00.000Z)
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ The monitoring system detected the problem
- ✅ The alert rule worked correctly
- ✅ The incident is being tracked

## 🌐 Step 8: Explore the Monitoring Dashboards

## 🎯 Step 9: Practical Monitoring Scenarios

### Scenario A: Investigating High Error Rates

**Situation**: You notice alerts firing for high error rates.

**Step-by-step investigation:**

1. **Check Prometheus Alerts**
   ```
   1. Go to http://localhost:8080/prometheus/
   2. Click "Alerts" tab
   3. Find "HighErrorRate" alert
   4. Note the current value vs threshold
   ```

2. **Query Error Details**
   ```promql
   # Find which endpoints are failing:
   brainbytes_http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}
   
   # Check error rate by endpoint:
   rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])
   
   # Compare with total requests:
   rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m])
   ```

3. **Visualize in Grafana**
   ```
   1. Go to http://localhost:8080/grafana/
   2. Open "Error Analysis Dashboard"
   3. Set time range to "Last 15 minutes"
   4. Look for spikes in error rate graph
   5. Check which services are affected
   ```

4. **Check Container Resources**
   ```
   1. Go to http://localhost:8080/cadvisor/
   2. Look for containers with high resource usage
   3. Check if resource limits are being hit
   4. Correlate timing with error spikes
   ```

### Scenario B: Performance Degradation Analysis

**Situation**: Users report slow response times.

**Investigation workflow:**

1. **Check Response Time Metrics**
   ```promql
   # Average response time:
   rate(brainbytes_http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) / rate(brainbytes_http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])
   
   # 95th percentile response time:
   histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(brainbytes_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
   ```

2. **Identify Bottlenecks**
   ```promql
   # CPU usage by container:
   rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m]) * 100
   
   # Memory usage:
   container_memory_usage_bytes / container_spec_memory_limit_bytes * 100
   
   # Network I/O:
   rate(container_network_receive_bytes_total[5m])
   ```

## 🔧 Step 10: Advanced Prometheus Queries

### Essential PromQL Functions

#### Rate and Increase Functions
```promql
# Rate: per-second average over time window
rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m])

# Increase: total increase over time window
increase(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m])

# irate: instantaneous rate (last 2 points)
irate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m])
```

#### Aggregation Functions
```promql
# Sum across all instances:
sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m]))

# Average by service:
avg by (service) (rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m]))

# Maximum value:
max(brainbytes_http_requests_total)

# Count of series:
count(brainbytes_http_requests_total)
```

#### Mathematical Operations
```promql
# Calculate percentage:
(sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m]))) * 100

# Difference between metrics:
metric_a - metric_b

# Ratio calculation:
metric_a / metric_b
```

### Custom Alert Rules Examples

#### High Error Rate Alert
```yaml
- alert: HighErrorRate
  expr: (sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m]))) * 100 > 5
  for: 2m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "High error rate detected"
    description: "Error rate is {{ $value }}% which is above the 5% threshold"
```

#### High Response Time Alert
```yaml
- alert: HighResponseTime
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(brainbytes_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 2
  for: 3m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "High response time detected"
    description: "95th percentile response time is {{ $value }}s"
```

## 📊 Step 11: Advanced Grafana Techniques

### Creating Custom Dashboards

#### Step 1: Create New Dashboard
```
1. Click "+" icon in left sidebar
2. Select "Dashboard"
3. Click "Add new panel"
```

#### Step 2: Configure Panel

### Advanced Panel Types

#### Single Stat Panels
```promql
# Current error rate:
(sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m]))) * 100

# Total requests today:
increase(brainbytes_http_requests_total[24h])
```

#### Table Panels
```promql
# Top errors by endpoint:
topk(10, sum by (endpoint) (rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])))

# Resource usage by container:
sum by (name) (rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m]) * 100)
```

## 🚨 Step 12: Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: "No data points" in Grafana
**Symptoms:**
- Panels show "No data points"
- Queries return empty results

**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. **Check Prometheus connectivity:**
   ```
   Go to Grafana → Configuration → Data Sources
   Test Prometheus connection
   ```

2. **Verify metrics exist:**
   ```
   Go to Prometheus → Query tab
   Search for your metric name
   Check if data is being scraped
   ```

3. **Check time range:**
   ```
   Ensure time range covers period when data exists
   Try "Last 24 hours" to see if any data appears
   ```

#### Issue 2: Alerts not triggering
**Symptoms:**
- Metrics show problem conditions
- Alerts remain in "Inactive" state

**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. **Check alert rule syntax:**
   ```
   Go to Prometheus → Status → Rules
   Look for syntax errors in rules
   ```

2. **Verify evaluation frequency:**
   ```
   Check prometheus.yml configuration:
   evaluation_interval: 15s
   ```

3. **Test alert expression:**
   ```
   Copy alert expression to Query tab
   Execute to see current value
   Compare with alert threshold
   ```

#### Issue 3: High memory usage
**Symptoms:**
- Prometheus consuming excessive memory
- System becoming slow

**Solutions:**
1. **Adjust retention settings:**
   ```yaml
   # In prometheus.yml:
   global:
     retention.time: 15d  # Reduce from default 15d
     retention.size: 10GB # Set size limit
   ```

2. **Optimize queries:**
   ```promql
   # Avoid high cardinality queries:
   # Bad: sum by (instance_id) (metric)
   # Good: sum by (service) (metric)
   ```

### Performance Optimization Tips

#### Prometheus Optimization
```yaml
# prometheus.yml optimizations:
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s      # Balance between accuracy and load
  evaluation_interval: 15s  # Match scrape interval
  
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'app'
    scrape_interval: 30s    # Less critical metrics
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['app:8080']
```

#### Query Optimization
```promql
# Efficient queries:
sum(rate(metric[5m])) by (service)

# Avoid inefficient queries:
sum(rate(metric[5m])) by (instance, pod, container)
```

## 🛠️ Step 13: Resolve the Incident

Now let's stop the incident:

```bash
cd monitoring/scripts && node incident-simulator.js resolve HIGH_ERROR_RATE
```

**Expected output:**
```
2025-01-23T10:05:00.000Z ✅ Resolving High Error Rate incidents...
2025-01-23T10:05:00.100Z ✅ Stopped error generation for incident high-error-1642939260000
```

**What happens next:**
1. Error generation stops immediately
2. Error rate drops to normal levels
3. Prometheus continues monitoring for 2-3 minutes
4. Alert automatically resolves when error rate stays low
5. Alertmanager marks the alert as resolved

## 📈 Step 10: Verify Resolution

Wait 2-3 minutes, then check status:

```bash
node incident-simulator.js status
```

**Expected output:**
```
2025-01-23T10:07:00.000Z ℹ️ === SYSTEM STATUS ===
2025-01-23T10:07:00.100Z ✅ No active alerts
2025-01-23T10:07:00.150Z ✅ No active incidents
```

**Understanding alert resolution:**
- Alerts don't resolve instantly
- Prometheus needs to confirm the issue is gone
- This prevents flapping alerts from brief fixes

## 🧪 Step 11: Try Different Incident Types

Now that you understand the process, try other incidents:

### CPU Incident
```bash
# Trigger high CPU usage
node incident-simulator.js trigger HIGH_CPU

# Wait 2-3 minutes and check cAdvisor
# Open: http://localhost:8081

# Resolve when done testing
node incident-simulator.js resolve HIGH_CPU
```

### Container Memory Incident
```bash
# Trigger memory consumption
node incident-simulator.js trigger CONTAINER_MEMORY

# Monitor in cAdvisor and Grafana
# Expected alert: ContainerHighMemory

# Resolve when done
node incident-simulator.js resolve CONTAINER_MEMORY
```

### AI Service Slowdown
```bash
# Simulate slow AI responses
node incident-simulator.js trigger AI_SERVICE_SLOW

# Expected alert: SlowAiResponse
# Check AI service metrics in Grafana

# Resolve when done
node incident-simulator.js resolve AI_SERVICE_SLOW
```

### Mobile Connectivity Issues
```bash
# Simulate mobile connection problems
node incident-simulator.js trigger MOBILE_CONNECTIVITY

# Expected alert: HighMobileErrorRate
# Monitor mobile-specific metrics

# Resolve when done
node incident-simulator.js resolve MOBILE_CONNECTIVITY
```

## 🚨 Emergency: Resolve All Incidents

If you need to stop everything immediately:

```bash
node incident-simulator.js resolve-all
```

This stops all active incidents instantly.

## 🔧 Step 12: Clear Active System Alerts

**NEW FEATURE:** If you have real system alerts firing (not from the simulator), you can clear them using:

```bash
node incident-simulator.js clear-alerts
```

**What this does:**
1. **Generates Normal Traffic**: Creates 2000 successful HTTP requests to dilute error rates
2. **Simulates User Activity**: Makes requests to user endpoints to clear NoActiveUsers alerts
3. **Waits for Metrics Update**: Allows 30 seconds for Prometheus to process new metrics
4. **Shows Updated Status**: Displays current alert status after resolution attempt

**Expected output:**
```

```

**When to use `clear-alerts`:**
- You have real system alerts firing (not from simulator incidents)
- Error rate alerts are stuck due to previous testing
- NoActiveUsers alert is firing due to lack of user sessions
- You want to reset the monitoring system to a clean state

**Understanding the difference:**
- `resolve <INCIDENT_TYPE>`: Stops simulator-generated incidents
- `resolve-all`: Stops all simulator-generated incidents
- `clear-alerts`: Clears real system alerts by generating counter-metrics

## 🔧 Step 13: Manual Alert Resolution Through Monitoring Interfaces

You can also resolve alerts manually through the monitoring web interfaces:

### Method 1: Prometheus Alert Silencing

**Access Prometheus:**
```
URL: http://localhost:9090
```

**Steps to silence alerts:**
1. Navigate to **Alerts** tab
2. Find the firing alert (e.g., "HighErrorRate")
3. Click **Silence** button next to the alert
4. Set silence duration (e.g., "1h" for 1 hour)
5. Add reason: "Manual resolution during testing"
6. Click **Create Silence**

**What this does:**
- Temporarily suppresses alert notifications
- Alert still fires but notifications are blocked
- Useful during maintenance or known issues

### Method 2: Alertmanager Silence Management

**Access Alertmanager:**
```
URL: http://localhost:9093
```

**Steps to create silences:**
1. Click **Silences** tab
2. Click **New Silence** button
3. **Matchers**: Add alert labels to match (e.g., `alertname="HighErrorRate"`)
4. **Duration**: Set how long to silence (e.g., "2h")
5. **Comment**: Add reason for silence
6. Click **Create**

**Advanced silence matching:**
```
# Silence specific alert
alertname="HighErrorRate"

# Silence all alerts from a service
service="backend"

# Silence alerts with specific severity
severity="warning"

# Multiple conditions (AND logic)
alertname="HighErrorRate" service="backend"
```

### Method 3: Fix Root Cause (Recommended)

**For Error Rate Alerts:**
1. **Identify the source** of errors in application logs
2. **Fix the bug** causing 5xx responses
3. **Deploy the fix** to production
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for error rate to drop below threshold
5. **Alert automatically resolves** when conditions improve

**For NoActiveUsers Alert:**
1. **Create user sessions** by logging into the application
2. **Generate user activity** through normal application usage
3. **Wait for metrics update** (usually 1-2 minutes)
4. **Alert resolves** when `brainbytes_active_sessions > 0`

### Method 4: Grafana Alert Management

**Access Grafana:**
```
URL: http://localhost:3003
Username: admin
Password: brainbytes123
```

**Steps to manage alerts:**
1. Navigate to **Alerting** → **Alert Rules**
2. Find the problematic alert rule
3. **Options available:**
   - **Pause**: Temporarily disable the alert rule
   - **Edit**: Modify thresholds or conditions
   - **Delete**: Remove the alert rule entirely
   - **Silence**: Create a silence for this specific rule

**Temporary threshold adjustment:**
1. Edit the alert rule
2. Increase the threshold temporarily (e.g., from 5% to 20%)
3. Save changes
4. Alert will resolve if current value is below new threshold
5. **Remember to restore** original threshold later

### Method 5: Direct Metric Manipulation

**Generate counter-metrics to resolve alerts:**

**For Error Rate Alerts:**
```bash
# Generate successful requests to dilute error rate
for i in {1..1000}; do
  curl -s http://localhost/health > /dev/null
done
```

**For NoActiveUsers Alert:**
```bash
# Simulate user login/activity
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"testpass"}'
```

**For CPU/Memory Alerts:**
```bash
# Stop resource-intensive processes
docker-compose restart backend
docker-compose restart ai-service
```

### Best Practices for Manual Resolution

1. **Always document** why you're resolving alerts manually
2. **Fix root causes** rather than just silencing alerts
3. **Use silences sparingly** - they can hide real problems
4. **Set appropriate durations** for silences (not too long)
5. **Monitor after resolution** to ensure problems don't return
6. **Update runbooks** based on resolution experiences

### When to Use Each Method

| Method | Use Case | Duration | Impact |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Prometheus Silence** | Quick testing, known issues | Short-term | Blocks notifications only |
| **Alertmanager Silence** | Maintenance windows | Medium-term | Advanced matching options |
| **Root Cause Fix** | Production issues | Permanent | Solves actual problem |
| **Grafana Management** | Rule adjustments | Variable | Changes alert behavior |
| **Metric Manipulation** | Testing, demonstrations | Short-term | Temporary metric changes |

### 🚨 Important Notes

- **Silences don't fix problems** - they only suppress notifications
- **Always investigate** why alerts are firing before silencing
- **Document all manual interventions** for future reference
- **Test alert resolution** in development before applying to production
- **Monitor system behavior** after manual resolution to ensure stability

## 📊 Understanding the Metrics Flow

Here's how the monitoring system works:

```
1. Application/Container → Generates metrics
2. cAdvisor → Collects container metrics
3. Node Exporter → Collects host metrics  
4. Prometheus → Scrapes all metrics every 15s
5. Alert Rules → Evaluate conditions every 15s
6. Alertmanager → Receives and routes alerts
7. Grafana → Visualizes metrics and alerts
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Cannot find module" Error
**Problem:** Running from wrong directory
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd C:\Users\Honey\Desktop\BrainBytesAI\monitoring\scripts
node incident-simulator.js status
```

### "Services Not Available"
**Problem:** Monitoring stack not running
**Solution:**
```bash
# Go back to project root
cd C:\Users\Honey\Desktop\BrainBytesAI

# Check if containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Start if not running
docker-compose up -d
```

### Alerts Not Triggering
**Problem:** Alert rules need time to evaluate
**Solution:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes after triggering incident
- Check Prometheus targets: http://localhost:9090/targets
- Verify alert rules: http://localhost:9090/rules

### High CPU Incident Not Working on Windows
**Problem:** `stress` command not available
**Solution:** The script will fall back to a Node.js CPU intensive task automatically

## 🎯 Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Navigate to correct directory
cd C:\Users\Honey\Desktop\BrainBytesAI\monitoring\scripts

# Basic commands
node incident-simulator.js status                    # Check system status

## 🧪 Latest Testing Results & Verification

### Testing Session: January 23, 2025

During our comprehensive testing session, we verified the complete incident simulation workflow and discovered several important findings:

#### ✅ **Successfully Verified Components:**

1. **Monitoring Stack Accessibility**
   - All services accessible via nginx reverse proxy at `http://localhost:8080/`
   - Prometheus: `http://localhost:8080/prometheus/`
   - Grafana: `http://localhost:8080/grafana/`
   - Alertmanager: `http://localhost:8080/alertmanager/`
   - cAdvisor: `http://localhost:8080/cadvisor/`

2. **Incident Simulator Functionality**
   - Successfully generates 500 errors at 10 errors/second rate
   - Proper error endpoint: `/api/simulate-error` returns HTTP 500 status
   - Metrics collection confirmed: 600+ error requests recorded
   - Error generation verified through Prometheus metrics

3. **Backend Error Simulation**
   - Added dedicated `/api/simulate-error` endpoint in `backend/server.js`
   - Endpoint consistently returns HTTP 500 errors for testing
   - Proper error response format with JSON error details

#### 🔧 **Issues Discovered & Fixed:**

1. **Docker Compose Volume Mounting**
   - **Problem:** Prometheus alert rules weren't loading due to incorrect volume paths
   - **Solution:** Fixed volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml` to properly map rules directory
   - **Result:** Alert rules now properly accessible to Prometheus

2. **Error Generation Method**
   - **Problem:** Original simulator generated 404 errors instead of 5xx errors needed for alerts
   - **Solution:** Updated simulator to use `/api/simulate-error` endpoint
   - **Result:** Now generates proper HTTP 500 errors for alert triggering

3. **Service Connectivity**
   - **Problem:** Simulator couldn't reach services due to nginx proxy configuration
   - **Solution:** Updated URLs to use proper nginx proxy paths
   - **Result:** All monitoring services now accessible and functional

#### 📊 **Prometheus Query Verification:**

The following queries have been tested and confirmed working:

```promql
# Count of 500 errors (should show 600+ during incident)
brainbytes_http_requests_total{status_code="500"}

# Error rate percentage (should show >5% during incident)
(sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m]))) * 100

# Total HTTP requests
brainbytes_http_requests_total
```

#### 🚨 **Alert Rule Configuration:**

Alert rules are properly configured in `monitoring/configs/prometheus/rules/alert-rules.yml`:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: brainbytes_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: (sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(brainbytes_http_requests_total[5m]))) * 100 > 5
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High error rate detected"
          description: "Error rate is {{ $value }}% which is above the 5% threshold"
```

#### 🎯 **Current Testing Status:**

- ✅ **Incident Simulator**: Fully functional, generating proper 500 errors
- ✅ **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus successfully collecting error metrics
